# This approach has 2 models in the same YML file, and uses YML anchors
# to reuse column definitions.
# The advantage to this is that it allows you to define descriptions and tests whereas
# dbt document blocks https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation#using-docs-blocks
# can only be used for descriptions. However, a disadvantage is that YML anchors can't be reused across files.
