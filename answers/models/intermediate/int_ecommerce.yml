# An example of putting 2 models in the same YML file
# This has some advantages in being able to use YML anchors (more on that below)
# and having less files. But it has a disadvantage of being cluttered if you put too much in 1 file

models:
  - name: int_ecommerce__order_items_products
    description: "Order item data joined to product data"
    columns:
      - name: order_item_id
        tests:
          - not_null:
              severity: error
          - unique:
              severity: error

      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - not_null

      # The "&" is a YML anchor which I can reference later in the file
      - &user_id
        name: user_id
        description: "Unique identifier for a user"
        tests:
          - not_null

    columns:
      # The * allows you to reference the YML anchor above for &user_id
      # This will bring through everything under that anchor: name, description, tests etc.
      - *user_id
      # If you didn't want to bring everything through from the anchor you can do this:
      # - <<: *user_id
      #   description: "New description"
      # This would keep the name & tests defined in the anchor, but overwrite the description
